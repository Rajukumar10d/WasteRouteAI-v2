# Problem Statement  
### Smart Waste Routing & Collection System

---

## 1. Background

Rapid urbanization has significantly increased the volume of municipal solid waste in metropolitan cities like Hyderabad. Managing this waste efficiently is a major challenge for urban local bodies such as the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC).

Traditional waste collection systems rely on **fixed schedules, manual planning, and static routes**, which often leads to inefficiencies and delayed waste clearance.

---

## 2. Existing Challenges

### 2.1 Inefficient Route Planning
- Collection routes are predefined and static
- No optimization based on distance, traffic, or waste levels
- Results in longer travel time and higher fuel consumption

### 2.2 Overflowing Waste Collection Points
- Garbage Vulnerable Points (GVPs) often overflow due to delayed pickups
- Lack of real-time monitoring of waste levels
- Leads to unhygienic conditions and public health risks

### 2.3 Poor Visibility & Monitoring
- No centralized dashboard for real-time monitoring
- Limited tracking of truck movements
- Difficult for authorities to assess operational efficiency

### 2.4 Manual & Reactive Operations
- Decisions are taken after issues occur
- Heavy dependency on human judgment
- High chances of human error and inefficiency

### 2.5 Lack of Data-Driven Insights
- No historical analytics for planning
- No prediction of future waste generation
- Poor utilization of collected operational data

## 3. Need for a Smart Solution

To address these challenges, there is a strong need for a **technology-driven, intelligent waste management system** that can:

- Optimize waste collection routes dynamically
- Provide real-time visualization of waste points and vehicles
- Improve operational efficiency using data and AI
- Support decision-making through analytics and dashboards

---

## 4. Problem Definition

> **Design and develop a Smart Waste Routing & Collection System that uses real-time data, optimized routing algorithms, and intelligent monitoring to improve municipal waste collection efficiency while reducing operational cost, response time, and environmental impact.**

---

## 5. Objectives

- Minimize total travel distance and collection time
- Prevent overflow of garbage collection points
- Enable real-time monitoring of trucks and waste points
- Support scalable and data-driven waste management
- Align with Smart City and sustainable development initiatives

---

## 6. Scope of the Problem

The problem focuses on:
- Urban municipal waste collection
- Route optimization between GVPs and SCTPs
- Operational monitoring for municipal authorities
- Intelligent decision support systems

---

## 7. Conclusion

Efficient waste management is a critical requirement for smart cities. Addressing the limitations of traditional systems through intelligent routing, real-time monitoring, and data-driven optimization is essential to ensure cleanliness, public health, and sustainable urban living.

This project aims to bridge this gap by providing a **scalable, intelligent, and practical solution** for modern urban waste management.
